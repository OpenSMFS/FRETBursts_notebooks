What's this?
------------

This repository contains Jupyter/IPython Notebook tutorials for the
[FRETBursts](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts) burst analysis software.
The same notebooks are included in the
[FRETBursts source](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/tree/master/notebooks)
but the version here contains all the execution outputs (text, tables and figures)
and are therefore easier to read as tutorials.

To view the tutorials online see links below. You can also download and 
execute the notebooks locally (use the **Download ZIP** button on the right),
but to do that you also need to 
[install FRETBursts](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html).

The datasets used by the tutorials (which are automatically downloaded on first notebook execution) 
can be found here:
