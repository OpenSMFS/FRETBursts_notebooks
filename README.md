FRETBursts Notebooks
====================

What's this?
------------

This repository contains Jupyter/IPython Notebook tutorials for the
[FRETBursts](http://tritemio.github.io/FRETBursts/) burst analysis software.
The same notebooks are included in the
[FRETBursts source](https://github.com/tritemio/FRETBursts/tree/master/notebooks)
but the version here contains all the execution outputs (text, tables and figures)
and are therefore easier to read.

To download the tutorial for local execution use the **Download ZIP** button.
You also need to [install FRETBursts](http://fretbursts.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html).

Datasets
--------

FRETBursts notebooks use [public smFRET datasets](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1456362.v13) 
that are automatically downloaded the first time each notebook is executed.
